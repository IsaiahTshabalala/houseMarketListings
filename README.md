# houseMarketListings
This is a web app where users can basically look for and create Property listings.
It uses React for the front-end, and Firebase for the database (Firestore) and storage.
This project was undertaken as part of learning React under the course REACT FRONT TO BACK by Brad Traversy.
I took it a few steps further in order to learn more about React and Firestore.
